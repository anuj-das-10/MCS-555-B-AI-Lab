**1. Given the following facts:**
>- Steve only likes easy course.
>- Science course are hard.
>- All the courses in the basket weaving department are easy.
>- BK301 is a basket weaving course.

Write a program to find ‚ÄúWhat course would Steve like?‚Äù

```prolog
% Define likes predicate for Steve based on easy courses
likes(steve, Course):- easy_course(Course).

% Define predicate for science courses being hard
hard_course(science_course).

% Define predicate for courses in the basket weaving department being easy
easy_course(Course):- basket_weaving_course(Course).

% Define BK301 as a basket weaving course
basket_weaving_course(bk301).

**3. Given the following facts:**
>- John likes all food.
>- Apples are food.
>- Chicken is food.
>- Anything anyone eats and isn‚Äôt killed by is food.
>- Bill eats Peanuts and is still alive.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a) Write a Program to prove that ‚ÄúJohn likes peanuts‚Äù. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; b) Find ‚Äúwhat food does Sue eat?‚Äù

```prolog
% Define likes predicate for John based on food
likes(john, X):- food(X).

% Define what constitutes food
food(apple).
food(chicken).
food(peanuts).

% Directive to handle non-consecutive clauses for eats/2 predicate
:- discontiguous eats/2.

% Define food predicate based on what is eaten and not killed by
food(X):- eats(A, X), alive(A, X).

% Define who eats peanuts
eats(bill, peanuts).

% Define that Bill is alive after eating peanuts
alive(bill, peanuts).

% Define what Sue eats based on what Bill eats
eats(sue, X) :- eats(bill, X).

**4. Given the following facts:**
>- All people who are not poor and are smart are happy.
>- Those people who read are not stupid but smart.
>- John could read and is wealthy.
>- Happy people have exciting lives.
 
Write a Program to prove ‚ÄúJohn has an exciting life‚Äù.

```prolog

smart(X):- reads(X).

% Define predicate for happiness
happy(X):- not(poor(X)), smart(X).

stupid(X):- not(smart(X)).

% Define predicate for exciting lives
exciting_life(X):- happy(X).

% Define predicate for being poor(assuming all those not wealthy are poor)
poor(X):- not(wealthy(X)).

    (   integer(N), 
    	% If condition is true, calculate factorial	
   		N >= 0 ->
        calculate_factorial(N, Result),
        % Format and print the factorial result
        format("Factorial of ~d is ~d.~n", [N, Result])
    ;   % If condition is false, print error message
        writeln("Error: Input must be a non-negative integer."), fail
